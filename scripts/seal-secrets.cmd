echo   EDGEWEAVER - SEAL THE SECRETS BUNDLE
echo  ============================================================
echo.
echo   You need ONE thing: a passphrase of 4-5 random words that
echo   you have MEMORIZED and WRITTEN ON PAPER kept at home.
echo   That paper + your memory are the vault. Nothing else is.
echo.
echo   Steps this window will walk you through:
echo     1. Notepad opens the age key - hand-copy the line that
echo        starts AGE-SECRET-KEY- onto the same paper (gold!).
echo     2. Type your passphrase twice to SEAL the bundle.
echo     3. Type it once more to VERIFY the seal opens.
echo     4. Plaintext secrets are deleted; sealed copies are
echo        placed on your Desktop and in the private backups repo.
echo.
