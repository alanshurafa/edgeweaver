# Edgeweaver Genesis Telegram channel launcher (ASCII only). Run by the watchdog via
# -File, never -Command: Start-Process -Command payloads MANGLE embedded quotes (proven
# 2026-07-16 on the Alpha side, when a dropped env assignment cross-wired the bots).
# EDGEWEAVER_CHANNEL_BEING marks this as a channel session for the stall-alert hooks
# (channel-notify-hook.mjs); it must be set BEFORE claude starts so hooks inherit it.
# Genesis's Telegram state lives in its OWN dir (moved 2026-07-21): any stray session
# with the telegram plugin enabled defaults to ~/.claude/channels/telegram and hijacks
# whatever token lives there (happened twice on 2026-07-21: an ops desktop session at
# 12:16 and the staff-program login at 14:36; the plugin's stale-holder logic kills the
# legitimate poller each time). TWO-LAYER GOTCHA, proven live 14:53-14:57: claude's
# channel-attach probes the DEFAULT dir to decide the channel is configured (empty dir =
# channel silently never attaches, no poller, no error), while the spawned server reads
# TELEGRAM_STATE_DIR. So the default dir MUST hold the DECOY config (invalid token; see
# its README.md) - never delete it, never put a real token in it.
