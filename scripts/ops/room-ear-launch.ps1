# Sibling room ear launcher (ASCII only; D44). Runs the listener-only bot that mirrors
# human messages from the one shared topic into ew_ops.sibling_room (room-ear.mjs;
# token EW_SIBLING_EAR_TOKEN in repo .env.local, never here). Self-healing loop: if
# the ear exits (network blip, node crash), wait 30s and start it again. Runs from the
# scheduled task \Edgeweaver\EdgeweaverRoomEar (logon + every 15 min, since 2026-09-03),
# so every tick is also a watchdog pass:
#   - no ear running            -> this instance becomes the ear's keeper (loop below)
#   - ear running, heartbeat ok -> exit, nothing to do
#   - ear running, heartbeat stale (state/sibling-ear-heartbeat.txt older than 5 min while
#     the process is older than 5 min) -> a hung ear; end that node process and exit. The
#     keeper's loop starts a fresh ear within 30s (the Telegram offset lives in the cursor
#     file, so nothing is lost). Two ears on one token would fight over getUpdates
#     (one-poller-per-token, proven 2026-07-16), which is why a healthy ear is left alone.
