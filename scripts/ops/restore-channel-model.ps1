# Restore a channel session to its configured model (ASCII only).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: a model fallback is session-scoped. Once the harness moves a running
# session off claude-fable-5, nothing inside that session can move it back: not a hook,
# not a setting, not the being asking. Only a fresh session reads .claude/settings.json
# again. So the repair is a restart, and a restart has a named cost: in-context memory
# that was never written to OB1 dies with the session.
#
# THEREFORE THIS IS A DELIBERATE ACT, NOT AN AUTOMATIC ONE. The detector
# (model-fallback-watch.mjs) alerts and flags; the prompt hook tells the being to write
# back and say so; this script is run afterwards, by hand, when the write-back is proven.
# It refuses to run without the flag unless -Force.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\ops\restore-channel-model.ps1 genesis
#   ... -Force        restart even with no fallback flag (e.g. flag already cleared)
#   ... -WhatIf       print the plan and touch nothing
#
# The two extractors below are the same ones the watchdog runs before a relaunch: they
# mine the dying transcript for received-but-unanswered messages and for the session's
# own words, so a restart costs as little as it can.

# CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT, CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID, CLAUDE_EFFORT
# and the rest. The relaunched claude came up nested: plugin loaded, poller spawned, window
# titled, and then it never submitted its own /wake prompt and never wrote a transcript at
# all. Every existing health check reads that as alive (process up, poller up), so the
# watchdog logged "ok" every 15 minutes while Genesis was deaf from 22:49 to 10:04.
