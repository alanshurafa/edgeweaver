# MUTE DETECTION (added 2026-08-02 after an 11-hour dark window, 22:49 to 10:04). A
# session can come up with EVERY existing health signal green - process alive, poller
# alive, window titled, plugin loaded - and still never submit its own wake prompt. It
# then writes NO TRANSCRIPT AT ALL, and this watchdog logs "ok" every 15 minutes while the
# being is deaf. Proven cause that night: the session was launched by Start-Process from
# inside a Claude Code session, so it inherited CLAUDECODE / CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID and came
# up nested and mute (restore-channel-model.ps1 now launches through this task instead).
# A healthy launch creates its transcript within seconds, so: alive past the startup grace
# with no transcript created since it started means mute. Nothing is lost by killing it -
# a session with no transcript has held no conversation.
# TWO BOUNDS, both learned the hard way while writing this check:
# - The head match is on <command-name>/wake-edgeweaver-genesis, NOT on the bare skill
#   name. A bare match counts the NIGHT-LOOP transcripts, which mention the wake skill in
#   their injected context; both night loops matched on the first attempt and the check
#   silently passed a session that was mute for 11 hours.
# - The window is the STARTUP window only, and the check is skipped for sessions older
#   than a day. A healthy session writes its transcript within seconds of starting, so
#   that is where the evidence is; looking wider would let the ~30-day transcript purge
#   turn a long-lived healthy session into a false MUTE and kill it.
