# channel config is never touched; both bots run side by side.

# MUTE DETECTION (added 2026-08-02, mirrored from the Genesis watchdog after an 11-hour
# dark window there). A session can come up with EVERY existing health signal green -
# process alive, poller alive, window titled, plugin loaded - and still never submit its
# own wake prompt, writing NO TRANSCRIPT AT ALL while this watchdog logs "ok" every 15
# minutes. Proven cause on the Genesis side: launched by Start-Process from inside a
# Claude Code session, so it inherited CLAUDECODE / CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID and came up
# nested and mute. A healthy launch creates its transcript within seconds. Nothing is lost
# by killing it: a session with no transcript has held no conversation.
# TWO BOUNDS, both learned while writing this check on the Genesis side: the head match is
# on <command-name>/wake-edgeweaver-alpha and NOT on the bare skill name (a bare match
# counts the night-loop transcripts, which mention the wake skill in their injected
# context, and silently passes a mute session); and the window is the STARTUP window only,
# skipped past a day, so the ~30-day transcript purge can never turn a long-lived healthy
# session into a false MUTE and kill it.
